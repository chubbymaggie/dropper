dropper
=======

Tool for automatic ROP chain generation

dropper aim to automatically generate a ROP chain capable of spwaning
a shell once injected in the stack of an executable.

It is in a very early stage of development and without documentation
:(

It uses the BARF framework [0] under the hood (but actually it works only
with the version of my fork[1]).

Feel free con contact me for info
